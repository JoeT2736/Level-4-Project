abstract = {A microscopic, stochastic, minimal model for collective and cohesive motion of identical self-propelled particles is introduced. Even though the particles interact strictly locally in a very noisy manner, we show that cohesion can be maintained, even in the zero-density limit of an arbitrarily large flock in an infinite space. The phase diagram spanned by the two main parameters of our model, which encode the tendencies for particles to align and to stay together, contains non-moving “gas”, “liquid” and “solid” phases separated from their moving counterparts by the onset of collective motion. The “gas/liquid” and “liquid/solid” are shown to be first-order phase transitions in all cases. In the cohesive phases, we study also the diffusive properties of individuals and their relation to the macroscopic motion and to the shape of the flock.}

abstract = {Bird flocking is a striking example of collective animal behaviour. A vivid illustration of this phenomenon is provided by the aerial display of vast flocks of starlings gathering at dusk over the roost and swirling with extraordinary spatial coherence. Both the evolutionary justification and the mechanistic laws of flocking are poorly understood, arguably because of a lack of data on large flocks. Here, we report a quantitative study of aerial display. We measured the individual three-dimensional positions in compact flocks of up to 2700 birds. We investigated the main features of the flock as a whole (shape, movement, density and structure) and we discuss these as emergent attributes of the grouping phenomenon. Flocks were relatively thin, of various sizes, but constant proportions. They tended to slide parallel to the ground and, during turns, their orientation changed with respect to the direction of motion. Individual birds kept a minimum distance from each other that was comparable to their wing span. The density within the aggregations was nonhomogeneous, as birds were packed more tightly at the border than the centre of the flock. These results constitute the first set of large-scale data on three-dimensional animal aggregations. Current models and theories of collective animal behaviour can now be tested against these data.}

    abstract = { Models of self-propelled particles (SPPs) are an indispensable tool to investigate collective animal behaviour. Originally, SPP models were proposed with metric interactions, where each individual coordinates with neighbours within a fixed metric radius. However, recent experiments on bird flocks indicate that interactions are topological: each individual interacts with a fixed number of neighbours, irrespective of their distance. It has been argued that topological interactions are more robust than metric ones against external perturbations, a significant evolutionary advantage for systems under constant predatory pressure. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing the stability of metric versus topological SPP models in three dimensions. We show that topological models are more stable than metric ones. We also show that a significantly better stability is achieved when neighbours are selected according to a spatially balanced topological rule, namely when interacting neighbours are evenly distributed in angle around the focal individual. Finally, we find that the minimal number of interacting neighbours needed to achieve fully stable cohesion in a spatially balanced model is compatible with the value observed in field experiments on starling flocks. }

	abstract = {Simulation models help to understand how individual interactions can lead to selforganization of large, moving polarized schools of fish. To some extend the underlying mechanisms in these models are still hypothetical. This paper investigates and confirms previously published results and suggests an alternative model. Previous models of fish schools used the assumption that individuals modify their swimming direction and speed as a reaction to a small fixed number of other individuals swimming closest to their own swimming direction (front priority). They also used discrete transitions between different reaction types to their neighbours (see Huth and Wissel, this volume). These models are able to simulate school movement in a homogeneous environment but fail under certain heterogeneous conditions (e.g. when schools meet obstacles) and do not adequately simulate the formation process of schools. We present an alternative model, in which a fish's new speed and swimming direction is influenced by all visible neighbours. Each neighbour contributes a vector component weighted according to its distance. These components are aggregated to determine to what extent the different behavioural modes of searching, attraction, parallel orientation and repulsion contribute to a modification of an individual's movement in a particular situation. The resulting model reproduces schooling behaviour, organization of schools and has fewer artificial requirements concerning a biological interpretation of the underlying mechanisms. It shows how a comparison of different modelling approaches, empirical observation of inter-organismic interaction, and physiological research can stimulate each other in order to understand a complex, dynamic phenomenon.},

abstract = {Many species of fish schools organize for short or longer periods of time without a leader. We searched for the behaviour patterns of the individual fish, which allow movement of such a school. On the basis of biological facts we constructed a number of behaviour models and tested them with computer simulations against biological reality. Basic assumptions of our simulations are: (1) The motion of a fish is only influenced by the position and orientation of its nearest neighbours. (2) The new velocity and the turning angle of each fish (after a time step) are calculated by probability distributions taking into account random influences. (3) The movement of each model fish is based upon the same behaviour model, i.e. the modelled fish group swims without a leader. The basic behaviour patterns are attraction, repulsion and parallel orientation. Our investigations show that it is very important how a fish mixes the influences of its neighbours. If a fish averages the influences of its neighbours, the model fish group shows the typical characteristics of a real fish school: strong cohesion and high degree of polarization. If a fish only responds to a single neighbour, the model creates a confused fish group.}

	abstract = {Complex collective motion patterns can emerge from very simple local interactions among individual agents. However, it is still unclear how and why the interactions among individuals lead to the emergence of collective motion. Modeling is an effective way to understand the mechanisms that govern collective animal motions. In this work, to avoid imposing fixed sets of rules on collective motion models a priori as classical approaches do, we propose a new method of modeling collective motion for fish schooling via multi-agent reinforcement learning. We model each fish individual as an artificial learning agent, whose policy is acquired by using mean field Q-learning (MFQ). The observation of each fish agent is represented as a multi-channel image, where each channel describes a different feature, such as an agent’s position or an agent’s orientation. The policy of an agent is approximated with a neural network trained with the MFQ algorithm, during which, agents are rewarded (or penalized) according to the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions between individuals. We study the dynamics of collective motion that emerge from the learned policy. The experimental results show that the learned policy can produce collective motion in groups of various sizes. In addition, three different collective motion patterns observed in nature emerged during the training process. The learned policy can help us gain new insight into how and why individual interactions lead to collective motion. This study also demonstrates that multi-agent reinforcement learning has great potential to be a new approach for analysis and modeling of collective motion.},

	abstract = {Fish schooling is a phenomenon of long-lasting interest in ethology and ecology, widely spread across taxa and ecological contexts, and has attracted much interest from statistical physics and theoretical biology as a case of self-organized behaviour. One topic of intense interest is the search of specific behavioural mechanisms at stake at the individual level and from which the school properties emerges. This is fundamental for understanding how selective pressure acting at the individual level promotes adaptive properties of schools and in trying to disambiguate functional properties from non-adaptive epiphenomena. Decades of studies on collective motion by means of individual-based modelling have allowed a qualitative understanding of the self-organization processes leading to collective properties at school level, and provided an insight into the behavioural mechanisms that result in coordinated motion. Here, we emphasize a set of paradigmatic modelling assumptions whose validity remains unclear, both from a behavioural point of view and in terms of quantitative agreement between model outcome and empirical data. We advocate for a specific and biologically oriented re-examination of these assumptions through experimental-based behavioural analysis and modelling.},

Previous attempts to model collective motion have primarily focused on group behaviours of identical individuals. In contrast, we put our emphasis on modelling the contributions of different individual-level characteristics within such groups by using stochastic asynchronous updating of individual positions and orientations. Our model predicts that higher updating frequency, which we relate to perceived threat, leads to more synchronized group movement, with speed and nearest-neighbour distributions becoming more uniform. Experiments with three-spined sticklebacks (
              Gasterosteus aculeatus
              ) that were exposed to different threat levels provide strong empirical support for our predictions. Our results suggest that the behaviour of fish (at different states of agitation) can be explained by a single parameter in our model: the updating frequency. We postulate a mechanism for collective behavioural changes in different environment-induced contexts, and explain our findings with reference to confusion and oddity effects.},

	abstract = {Individual-based models have shown that simple interactions among moving individuals (repulsion, attraction and alignment) result in travelling schools that resemble those of real ﬁsh. In most models individuals interact with all neighbours within sensory range which usually includes almost all the individuals of the school. Thus, it implies (almost) global perception. However, in reality in large groups, individuals will only interact with their neighbours close by, because they cannot perceive those farther away, since they are masked by closer ones. Here, we have developed a new model to investigate how such obstruction of perception inﬂuences aspects of social organization in schools of up to 10,000 individuals. We will show that in small schools of up to approximately 30 individuals group shape and density resembles that obtained with global perception, because in small schools hardly anyone is masked by others: school shape is oblong and the density is highest in the frontal half of the school. With increasing group size, from approximately 200 individuals onwards, internal density becomes variable over time, regions of high and low density develop at any location within a school, and group shape becomes more complex, in the sense that inward bounds and appendages occur more frequently. The complexity of shape and internal structure arises because, due to their limited perception, individuals interact relatively more locally in larger schools. In case of global perception, however, shape remains elliptical for all group sizes and in groups above 1000 individuals, the schools become unrealistically dense. In sum, our results show that obstructed perception in itself sufﬁces to generate a realistic organization of large schools and that no extra rules for ‘coping’ with many individuals are needed.},
