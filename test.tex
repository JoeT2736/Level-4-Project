\section{Notes}

\subsection{Collective motion in biological systems}

An important reason for the interest in collective motion is the appearance of new, extremely efficient and informative techniques to collect data about the details of motions within a collective of organisms.

A transition occurs from disorder to ordered motion (flocking), as a function of the relevant parameters. 

Thus, if a system is made of units

— that are rather similar;
— moving with a nearly constant absolute velocity and are capable of changing their direction (gaining momentum from interaction with the environment);
— interacting within a speciﬁc interaction range by changing their direction of motion, in a way involving ,an effective alignment; and
— which are subject to a noise of a varying magnitude,
collective motion is bound to occur in almost all of the possible cases.

Few dozen to few thousand units. Most real life observations are at mesoscopic scale.

Leaders/ informed individual having a priori preference. 

Units that can be reached by neighbouring units belong to same cluster. Behaviour within cluster highly correlated. 

Force mapping technique - infer interaction rules from experimental data. (GPS tracking of individuals within a flock).

\subsubsection{Vicsek Model}
Self-propelled particles at constant speed, choose at discrete time steps their new direction to be an average of that of their neighbours located within unit distance. Allingment rule competes with perturbations from noise term. This noise in the communication among individuals drives a phase transition.

\subsubsection{Gregoire}
Extra attraction-repulsion term in above model, so as to prevent the dissolving of flocks in open space.

\subsubsection{Ballerini}
Starling flocks - individuals interact mostly with neighbours determined by topological rules and not metric criteria.

\subsubsection{Camperi} 
Topological models much more stable against noise and external perturbations than metric.

\subsubsection{Couzin}
change in radius of orientation - sudden transitions at school level in terms of collective behaviours. 

\subsubsection{Hemelrijk \& Hildenbrandt}
Extension on zone models to account for speed variability. Discuss shape and internal structure of schools and flocks.

\subsubsection{Grunbaum}
Spatial memory effects - distribution at group level.

\subsubsection{Romanczuk \& Schimansky-Geier}
Self-propelled particles model - only attractive and repulsive interactions. For some parameter regime, large scale collective motion without any explicit velocity-allingment mechanism.

\subsubsection{Buhl}
Locusts - field recordings and computer simpulations, to infer interactions rules.

\subsubsection{Gautrais}
Animal group motion - data gathered from individual scale. Yields model without any free parameters. 



\subsection{Collective behaviour in animal groups: theoretical models and empirical studies}

Not only in social animals but also 'selfish' birds/fish.

Information flows through the system through interactions with neighbours or chemical deposition.

Particles/magnetic moments - interact locally in space and can generate an ordered state with collective global properties.

'mechanisms leading to collective behaviour are very general' - large scale features of many order-disorder transitions don't depend on the details of local interactions but only on some general characteristics of the system. (e.g. dimensionality of space) 'universality'

Biological systems have 'motive' - finding food/nesting areas. More difficult to understand, not 1 to 1 comparison with physical systems.

\subsubsection{Agent-based flocking models}

Good for mechanisms of decision making and group formation and how behavioural attitudes translate into global features.

Assume behavioural rules at the level of the individual. 

Evolution equation specified for each agent within system, and microscopic dynamics described in terms of the social forces acting upon it. 

Mostly used for schools, flocks and swarms. 
Force experienced by individual is due to neighbour's direct interaction.
(made for schools and flocks, later used for mammal herds and vertebrate groups)
Cohesive and polarised groups formed.

    1.Move in direction of neighbours (allingment of velocities)


    2.Remain close to neighbours (Attraction)


    3.Avoid collisions. (Short range repulsion.)

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\overrightarrow{d}_i}(t+1) = \frac{1}{n_{\text{in}}} \underset{\text{alignment}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\text{in}}} w_j \mathbf{\overrightarrow{d}_j}(t) \vphantom{\frac{1}{n_{\text{in}}} \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\text{in}}}}}  
+ \frac{1}{n_{\text{in}}} \underset{\text{attraction/repulsion}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\text{in}}} f_{ij} \frac{\mathbf{\overrightarrow{r}_{ij}}(t)}{\left|\mathbf{\overrightarrow{r}_{ij}}(t)\right|} \vphantom{\frac{1}{n_{\text{in}}}}} + \underset{{\text{noise}}}{\mathbf{\overrightarrow{\eta_i}}(t) \vphantom{\frac{1}{n_{\text{in}}}}},
\end{equation}

Equation for update of individual velocity
${\mathbf{\overrightarrow{d}_i}}$ - direction of motion of agent i

$\mathbf{\overrightarrow{r}_{ij}}$ - 
distance vector from agent i to j

$\mathbf{\overrightarrow{\eta_i}}$ -  stochastic noise modelling of uncertainty of decision making process. 

Alignment term = average over the directions of motion of the $\mathbf{n_{\text{in}}}$ interacting neighbours with weights $w_j$.

$f_{ij}$ force specifying how agent i attracted/repelled by agent j. Negative at short distance, positive at large.

Agent based models cannot be solved exactly. (number of individuals is large and resulting set of coupled dynamical eqs formally untreatable.) $\rightarrow$ implemented using numerical simulations. 

Neighbour preferences $\rightarrow$ angle/distance [Huth and Wissel, 1992]

COUZIN (2002) $\rightarrow$ relative extension of behavioural zones tuned to get, in 3D, groups of different shape, packing and alignment. {swarm-like aggregations (cohesion and low polarization), totoroidal milling groups (high polarization and global angularmomentum), and coherent dynamic groups (cohesion, high bpolarization and low momentum).} $\rightarrow$ strength of interaction terms analysed in Viscido, Parrish and Grunbaum (2004)

Macroscopic behaviour of materials from the microscopic behaviour of their components. 

Jadbadaie (2003) $\rightarrow$ Flocking achieved as long as network of agent interactions remains constant in time.

\subsubsection{Eulerian models}

Complementary approach to agent-based 

Deal with populations

The space represented as a lattice, the number of individuals within in the cell is followed over time. Instead of evolution of each individual as before.

Relevant variables $\rightarrow$ Density {n($\overrightarrow{x}$,t)/$V_{cell}$}, and average velocity $\overrightarrow{v}$($\overrightarrow{x}$,t) possessed by individuals in that cell.

Considering continuum limit $\rightarrow$ leads to convection-diffusion equations for the population density. (hydrodynamic eqs derived for fluids)

Eulerian models assume groups already formed, and a large enough number of members to make coarse graining meaningful. Cannot address features smaller than the cell or times shorter than that for info to reach outside the cell. $\rightarrow$ Useful for population evolution on long time scales and for patterns of large scales.


\subsubsection{Phenomelogical models}

Chemical cues $\rightarrow$ number of individuals performing a task depends on amount of perceived chemicals and so the number of individuals depositing chemical. $\rightarrow$ Ant trails

Given set of possible paths, a set of nonlinear equations can be written, describing the evolution in time of the flows of foragers along the paths

Mathematically simple.


\subsubsection{Empirical Studies}

Ballerini (2008) observational study $\rightarrow$ flocking behaviour of starlings $\rightarrow$ 3D study

Found flocks to be relatively thin and slide parallel to the ground $\rightarrow$ missed in 2D analysis.

Density and nearest neighbour distance independent of number of individuals in group. $\rightarrow$ contrary to that of small groups in previous studies.

Shape held constant proportions despite volume changes $\rightarrow$ underlying self organising mechanism. 

Angular dist of neighbours around focal individual $\rightarrow$ nearest neighbour likely to be found on sides rather than the direction of motion (as suggested to small groups of fish)

Flocks relatively sparse interacting units. Groups are denser at border than centre. 

When turning, shape remains unaltered and velocity rotates w.r.t flocks main axes. 

Interact depending on topological distance rather than metric distance and only with a fixed number of birds, not all neighbours within a fixed region of space.


\subsection{Novel Type of Phase Transition in a System of Self-Driven Particles}

Particles driven with constant absolute velocity, assumes average direction of motion of neighbouring particles with some random perturbation at each time step. $\rightarrow$ kinetic phase transition from no transport to finite net transport, through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry. Transition is continuous. 

Many particle systems $\rightarrow$ complex cooperative behaviour during phase transition. equilibrium systems [Scaling, universality, renormalisation] 

Far from equilibrium [Aggregation, viscous flows, biological pattern formation]

Model used is a transport related nonequilibrium analogue of the ferromagnetic type of models, difference of being inherently dynamic. $\rightarrow$ elementary event = motion of particle between two time steps. 

Ferromagnetic interaction aligning spins $\rightarrow$ aligning direction of motion of particles (random perturbation analogy with temperature.)
